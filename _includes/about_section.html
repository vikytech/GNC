        Geek Night is a monthly event to promote sharing of technical knowledge and increase collaboration between
        geeks in Chennai. It is organized by a passionate group of programmers and sponsored by ThoughtWorks.

        It happens on the <b>Last Thursday of every month</b>, unless that's a public holiday or any other
        unavoidable cause, like an Alien invasion.
